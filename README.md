## Overview

The app uses mDNS to automatically discover other libp2p peers on the same Local Area Netowork (LAN). Once discovered, you can begin a message thread with them similar to the Messages app.

## Why?

It's an example of how you can integrate swift-libp2p into an iOS App! ü•≥

## Try it out

Check it out by cloning this repo, opening in XCode and setting the appropriate developer signing settings, then run it on two devices connected to the same LAN!

## Contributing
